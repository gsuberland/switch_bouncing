# Switch bouncing traces

This repository contains a collection of example traces showing switch bouncing behaviour. This may be useful if you want some quick reference data for implementing robust debouncing systems in your circuits and firmware.

## Test conditions

The switches were configured as pull-downs, i.e. opening the switch leaves the voltage a +5.0V, and closing the switch pulls the output voltage to ground.

All traces were collected using the same procedure and equipment:

- Connect 5.0V to one terminal of the switch through a 10kÎ© resistor.
- Connect 0.0V to the other terminal of the switch, directly.
- Measure voltage across the switch.
  - 250MHz probe (x1)
  - PicoScope 3206B recording at 8.93MSa/s
  - 2V trigger, 1.5% hysteresis, 20% pre-trigger, both edges
- Press the button 32 times, resulting in 64 total traces (rising/falling edges)
  - Approximately 8 presses in 1 second spacings (holding for momentary).
  - Approximately 8 presses in rapid succession.
  - Approximately 8 presses with light or glancing actuation.
  - Approximately 8 presses with heavy force.
- If the switch is double-throw, record measurements for both the NO and NC contacts.



## Plots

These plots show 32 opening and 32 closing actions on top of each other for each device.

Remember that the switches were configured as pulldowns, so high voltage = open, low voltage = closed.

## Raw data

The raw data is available to download under this repository's releases section. The data is formatted as a CSV with a header, with each device in its own directory. For double-throw devices that have both normally-open and normally-closed forms, the device will have two directories suffixed with `-NO` and `-NC` respectively.

Voltages are simply in volts. Timestamps are in milliseconds. A timestamp of zero signifies the time at which the oscilloscope was triggered by a rising or falling edge. Negative timestamps are before the trigger, positive after the trigger.
